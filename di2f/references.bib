  abstract = {Merkle-DAG-backed CRDTs have been used to build some distributed applications on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). In this paper we study Merkle-DAGs as transport and persistence layer for CRDT data types, coining the term Merkle-CRDTs and providing an overview of the diﬀerent concepts, properties, advantages and limitations involved. We show how Merkle-CRDTs have the potential to greatly simplify the design and implementation of convergent data types in systems with weak messaging layer guarantees and a potentially large number of replicas.},

  title    = {Filecoin: {{A Decentralized Storage Network}}},
  abstract = {The internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with
decentralized open ones; trusted parties replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location addresses
replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decentralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and
transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars. These systems are the first instances of internetwide Open Services, where participants form a decentralized network providing useful services for pay,
with no central management or trusted parties. IPFS has proven the utility of content-addressing by
decentralizing the web itself, serving billions of files used across a global peer-to-peer network. It liberates data from silos, survives network partitions, works offline, routes around censorship, and gives
permanence to digital information.
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The
market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called “Filecoin”), which miners earn
by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute
data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining
power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin
mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves
these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The
network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and
repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat
models. The protocol’s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end
at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive
layer on top of IPFS [1], which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful
for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts},

However, decentralized infrastructures currently do not offer a way for users to easily explore available services in the network, nor the ability to securely verify their origin and history. In this contribution, we approach these challenges by exploiting the tamper-proofness of blockchain technology to build a decentralized service registry and discovery system for an existing decentralized microservice infrastructure. With this, users are able to find services in a network and are also able to verify their integrity and origin. Our first evaluations show promising results with this kind of system in the domain of decentralized service provisioning, while also raising research questions for future research in this field.},

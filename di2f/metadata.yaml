  While storage on the decentralized web has received a great deal of attention
  in research and practice, _services_ via open (or closed) attention
  programing interfaces have remained relatively under-utilized in peer-to-peer
  systems. This work-in-progress paper outlines initial work towards _discovery_
  of peer-to-peer services in an open and decentralized system. We focus on the
  use of decentralized identifiers (DID) as a means to identity, discover, and
  coordinate peer-to-peer services.

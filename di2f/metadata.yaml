abstract: |
  While data storage on the decentralized web has received a great deal of
  attention in research and practice, web services have remained relatively
  underutilized in peer-to-peer networks. This work-in-progress paper outlines
  the preliminary design of a decentralized, peer-to-peer service discovery
  system. In this system, peers can provide and request services, opening the
  door to a new "market of services" where providers and brokers can compete on
  metrics like price and uptime. Specifically, this report focuses on
  leveraging decentralized identifiers (DID) as a mechanism to discover these
  services.

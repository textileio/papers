  abstract = {Many distributed systems are now being developed to provide users with convenient access to data via some kind of communications network. In many cases it is desirable to keep the system functioning even when it is partitioned by network failures. A serious problem in this context is how one can support redundant copies of resources such as files (for the sake of reliability) while simultaneously monitoring their mutual consistency (the equality of multiple copies). This is difficult since network faiures can lead to inconsistency, and disrupt attempts at maintaining consistency. In fact, even the detection of inconsistent copies is a nontrivial problem. Naive methods either 1) compare the multiple copies entirely or 2) perform simple tests which will diagnose some consistent copies as inconsistent. Here a new approach, involving version vectors and origin points, is presented and shown to detect single file, multiple copy mutual inconsistency effectively. The approach has been used in the design of LOCUS, a local network operating system at UCLA.},

We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types supporting both \textbackslash{}add and \textbackslash{}remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial CRDTs.},

  abstract = {The bloom clock is a space-efficient, probabilistic data structure designed to determine the partial order of events in highly distributed systems. The bloom clock, like the vector clock, can autonomously detect causality violations by comparing its logical timestamps. Unlike the vector clock, the space complexity of the bloom clock does not depend on the number of nodes in a system. Instead it depends on a set of chosen parameters that determine its confidence interval, i.e. false positive rate. To reduce the space complexity from which the vector clock suffers, the bloom clock uses a 'moving window' in which the partial order of events can be inferred with high confidence. If two clocks are not comparable, the bloom clock can always deduce it, i.e. false negatives are not possible. If two clocks are comparable, the bloom clock can calculate the confidence of that statement, i.e. it can compute the false positive rate between comparable pairs of clocks. By choosing an acceptable threshold for the false positive rate, the bloom clock can properly compare the order of its timestamps, with that of other nodes in a highly accurate and space efficient way.},

  title = {Filecoin: {{A Decentralized Storage Network}}},
  abstract = {The internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with
decentralized open ones; trusted parties replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location addresses
replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decentralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and
transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars. These systems are the first instances of internetwide Open Services, where participants form a decentralized network providing useful services for pay,
with no central management or trusted parties. IPFS has proven the utility of content-addressing by
decentralizing the web itself, serving billions of files used across a global peer-to-peer network. It liberates data from silos, survives network partitions, works offline, routes around censorship, and gives
permanence to digital information.
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The
market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called “Filecoin”), which miners earn
by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute
data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining
power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin
mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves
these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The
network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and
repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat
models. The protocol’s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end
at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive
layer on top of IPFS [1], which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful
for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts},

  abstract = {The current infrastructure that underlies the distribution and processing of data over the Internet has enabled dramatic advances in a wide variety of human activities. Recent trends promoting open data promise even greater benefits as the number and variety of networked datasets grow. However, while current technologies and architectures obviously do work, they also show signs of systemic inefficiencies that impede effective large-scale discovery, distribution, preservation and reuse of datasets. An important source of inefficiency is rooted in the database-centric architecture that underlies much of data processing on the Internet today. The transition to a content-addressed permanent web offers an opportunity to replace certain software architecture patterns with alternatives that are more efficient and scale more effectively. We introduce one such new pattern, deterministic querying, that combines formalized query definitions, formalized data descriptions, linked metadata, hashing, and a content-addressed file system. The result supports database-free reuse of data and data processing results—and can do so on the scale of the global Internet.},

  abstract = {The Internet enables connectivity between many strangers: entities that don't know each other. We present the Trust Policy Language (TPL), used to define the mapping of strangers to predefined business roles, based on certificates issued by third parties. TPL is expressive enough to allow complex policies, e.g. non-monotone (negative) certificates, while being simple enough to allow automated policy checking and processing. Issuers of certificates are either known in advance, or provide sufficient certificates to be considered a trusted authority according to the policy. This allows bottom-up, "grass roots" buildup of trust, as in the real world. We extend, rather than replace, existing role based access control mechanisms. This provides a simple, modular architecture and easy migration from existing systems. Our system automatically collects missing certificates from peer servers. In particular this allows use of standard browsers, which pass only one certificate to the server. We describe our implementation, which can be used as an extension of a Web server or as a separate server with interface to applications.},

	abstract = {Community networks are successful large scale, decentralized IP networks, built and operated by citizens for citizens. Cloud computing infrastructures present in today's Internet hardly exist in community networks. But the demand for cloud storage, and in particular secure cloud storage, increases also from within the communities. We deploy in community networks Tahoe-LAFS, a decentralized storage system with provider-independent security that guarantees privacy to the users. The correct functionality of Tahoe-LAFS in the community network is our first performance evaluation goal. Secondly, acceptable user experience is needed in order to make users willing to join the cloud, to create an eco-system around this cloud storage service. Our approach for the performance evaluation is to reproduce in our experimental scenario the real use case. We evaluate how the Tahoe-LAFS storage system performs when it is deployed over a WAN setting on cloud nodes in a community network. In experiments we characterize with different file sizes the upload and download times of Tahoe-LAFS, in relation to the bandwidth and latency between the client and the storage nodes. While we observe higher upload and faster download times, Tahoe-LAFS performed correctly in the challenging environment of the community network. Our results suggest Tahoe-LAFS as a promising application for privacy-preserving, secure and fault-tolerant cloud-based storage services in community networks.},

Such modifications are well understood if performed sequentially on a single copy of the data, but if the data is replicated and modified concurrently on multiple devices, it is unclear what the semantics should be. In this paper we present an algorithm and formal semantics for a JSON data structure that automatically resolves concurrent modifications such that no updates are lost, and such that all replicas converge towards the same state (a conflict-free replicated datatype or CRDT). It supports arbitrarily nested list and map types, which can be modified by insertion, deletion and assignment. The algorithm performs all merging client-side and does not depend on ordering guarantees from the network, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices with poor network connectivity, in peer-to-peer networks, and in messaging systems with end-to-end encryption.},

Typically the parties will use some key agreement protocol (such as X3DH [1]) to agree on the shared secret key. Following this, the parties will use the Double Ratchet to send and receive encrypted messages.

The parties derive new keys for every Double Ratchet message so that earlier keys cannot be calculated from later ones. The parties also send Diffie-Hellman public values attached to their messages. The results of Diffie-Hellman calculations are mixed into the derived keys so that later keys cannot be calculated from earlier ones. These properties gives some protection to earlier or later encrypted messages in case of a compromise of a party's keys.

The Double Ratchet and its header encryption variant are presented below, and their security properties are discussed.},

  shorttitle = {{{SoK}}},
  abstract = {Motivated by recent revelations of widespread state surveillance of personal communication, many solutions now claim to offer secure and private messaging. This includes both a large number of new projects and many widely adopted tools that have added security features. The intense pressure in the past two years to deliver solutions quickly has resulted in varying threat models, incomplete objectives, dubious security claims, and a lack of broad perspective on the existing cryptographic literature on secure communication. In this paper, we evaluate and systematize current secure messaging solutions and propose an evaluation framework for their security, usability, and ease-of-adoption properties. We consider solutions from academia, but also identify innovative and promising approaches used "in-the-wild" that are not considered by the academic literature. We identify three key challenges and map the design landscape for each: trust establishment, conversation security, and transport privacy. Trust establishment approaches offering strong security and privacy features perform poorly from a usability and adoption perspective, whereas some hybrid approaches that have not been well studied in the academic literature might provide better trade-offs in practice. In contrast, once trust is established, conversation security can be achieved without any user involvement in most two-party conversations, though conversations between larger groups still lack a good solution. Finally, transport privacy appears to be the most difficult problem to solve without paying significant performance penalties.},

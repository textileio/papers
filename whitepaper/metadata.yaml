abstract: |
  As the Internet expands, the division between a person's digital and
  physical existence continues to blur. An emerging issue of concern is
  that the digital part of a person's life is being stored away from the
  person's control by companies behind apps and services on the Internet.
  An alternative architecture for data on the web, called user-siloed
  data, aims to reverse the flow of data and its derived value so that
  users, not apps capture it. In this paper, we investigate the data
  formats, access control, and transfer protocols necessary to build a
  system for user ownership of data. The proposed system aims to help
  power a new generation of web technologies. Our solution combines a
  novel use of event sourcing, Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD), and
  access control to provide a distributed, scalable, and flexible database
  solution for decentralized applications.
